# gpu.maths
Execute arithmetic operation on GPU

## POC
This is still a non-working proof of concept.

If you want to try it, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/GMartigny/gpu.maths.git
cd gpu.maths
npm install  # this might take a while
npm run benchmark
```

If you have trouble while installing the `gl` package, try running:
```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libxi-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev pkg-config
```
